## Data Science Project
Solutions to the following coding problems. The dataset used is the iris flower dataset. The Jupyter Notebook contains solutions to each of the following problems.

### Question 1
Find the details of all the plants which belong to the species 'Setosa'. 

### Question 2
Find the mean sepal_length of each species present in the dataset.

### Question 3
Double the petal_width of all plants which have a petal_width = 1.4

### Question 4
Show the details of the plant which has the maximum petal_length for each species. 

### Question 5
Apply the following function on the sepal_length value all the plants
Function Description: The function should sum the numbers on either side of the decimal point and return the sum.
example: function(5.2) = 7, function(7.4) = 11
(Hint : use pd.apply)

### Question 6
Find the species which has the maximum variation in it's sepal_width.
Variation is the difference between the max and min values of that feauture in the species.

### Question 7
Find out how many virginica plants have a greater sepal_length than the average sepal_length of the versicolor species.

### Question 8
Find out the species which has the maximum average petal area
(petal area = petal_length * petal_width)

### Question 9
Create seperate dataframes for the three species, and then join them using outer join. Return the resulting dataframe.
